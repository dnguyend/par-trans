PAR TRANS: Tractable Parallel transport
========================================
Par trans showcases a few manifolds with closed-form, computationally efficient parallel transport. The theory is developed in [NgSo24]_. Please refer to the `github repository <https://github.com/dnguyend/par-trans>`_ for installation instruction.
